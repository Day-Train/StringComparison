# StringComparison
This is a simple command line Java application to determine the similarlity between two strings.

The program demonstrates the use of several string comparison and metric utility classes organized into a single package org.alex.StringUtils. Examples of their use are captured in a separate class Main.java. The program prompts the user to enter two strings two compare along with parameters for the particular matching algorithms being used.
